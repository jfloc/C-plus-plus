# C-plus-plus

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For the project the main problem it was solving was using in conjunction both c++ code and python code to create a grocery sales tracking menu.
It allowed for us to see how much of a particular item was sold, a ASCII histogram and a total of all groceries sold listed in alphabetical order.

What did you do particularly well?
What I did particulary well was using the proper functions for connecting the python code and the c++ code together. It allowed for me to use
both the simple and relatively easy to use file reading capabilities of python and the quick processing of c++ in one.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code perhaps I could learn to make the python connecting functions more effecient and find possible memory leaks so that I could save possible errors.
I could perhaps help find other memory leaks within the code to avoid any possible errors if reuse and continuous running of this program was to be considered.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code was the verification for errors as I had to assure that I was making sure the data types and correct use of functions was being done correctly. I was able to overcome this by searching alot on how to verify certain data types through online searches. I am definitely keeping cplusplus.com handy.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning to connect two languages is a good first start for understanding how to combine all my knowledge together.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to break up the programming into functions and allowing myself to test each function separately for the desired functionality within the main. I could add a good test bench in the future to make sure that this programs functions work as intended if new updates are made.
